# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: In object oriented programming everything is an object and it organizes code into resusable blcoks that can hold methods and attribues. Fucntional programming is code based on creating and applying functions to create functioning programs. 

Researched answer: OOP has a clear structure to simplify maintainability and help make it reuseable through the use of Objects. FP uses high order fucntions to create complex code and operates on more immutable data and using those functions to create new answers. 

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float is a number with a decimal point like 5.6. A integer is a whole number like 5.

Researched answer: I was correct with my answer, and if coding with Ruby you must input a float number to receive one back, otherwise it will only return whole numbers. 

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return is a type of return that does not to be expressed in the programming language, the return is already imlied using the line of code. 

Researched answer:

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A ruby block is a block of code with a certain functionality.

Researched answer: Blocks can be enclosed in do/end statements or be passed through curly brackets, and is used to pass logic to a an object.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: You can extract a value from a ruby hash to access it by using the associated  [:key]

Researched answer: Another method that you can do is use fetch to pull the value from a specified key.

1. RSpec: testing framework for Ruby appliations that provides domain specific language to create tests for your code. 

2. Test-driven development: an approach to creating software programs by writing the test before actually writing the code. Red light green light method. 

3. PostgreSQL: open source relational database that allows data to be stored into tables. 

4. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This acronym represents operation fundamentals that we use to manipulate data in created programs. 

5. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol allows us to communicate and transfer info through the internet, it enables interactions between the user and the server.
